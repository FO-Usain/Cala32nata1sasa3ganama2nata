: To study the work with static and constant members of the class.
 The task:
**What**: Assignments for laboratory work No. 4 Static, constant and friendly members of the class
**How**: assign practical work 3 "Overloading operations"
**Why**: to complete the revision of the program in accordance with the tasks:
Static data members of the class 1. Add a static field int count, which acts as a counter of class objects.  
2. The destructor of the class must decrement the counter value by one.  3. Add a static method int getCount () that returns the value of the counter.  4. Demonstrate changing the value of a static field.  ASSIGNMENT 2. Constant methods and objects 1. Determine which methods are constant, define constant parameters and constant return values   of methods.  2. Add a constant field storing the object identifier (the number of the created object), provide methods for displaying information about the identifier.  3. Describe and initialize regular and constant objects.  4. Make calls to regular and constant methods for each type of object.  5. Test the program: Compile the program.  Are there any compilation errors and which ones?  If so, comment out the corresponding lines of code and re-compile.  What warnings are issued by the compiler and what is their meaning?  How can they be explained in terms of ensuring the reliability of the program?
